1.  Used GitHub to fork the project called Bulletin and used git clone in command line folled by the git read-only url

Before you do anything with Ruby you have to load the correct version from command line 

 rvm list //lists the version that I have 
 rvm use 1.9.2
 Open the (Bulletin) folder in sublime text >> config>>database.yml (changed all usernames to postgres and passwords to postgresql accordingly to the pgsdmin)
 bundle update
 rails server
 steamtunnel homepage accessible via: 0.0.0.0:3000 (default rails port)



Scraper (lib>>tasks>>scrape.rake)
 Open new terminal tab
 cd to Bulletin folder
 rake  scrape_all //for all // bundle exec rake scrape_all //crashed
 bundle exec rake scrape_sports   //may have issues with the thumbnails in which case call “bundle exec rake db:migrate”


Heroku (while in Bulletin)
 Run scrape command on Heroku   heroku  rake scrape_sports // in this case had to call “gem install heroku”
 heroku rake bundle exec rake scrape_sports –-app steamroom

 bundle exec rake db:seed //get default db data from db/seeds.rb
